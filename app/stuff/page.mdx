# Bag of Words

‚úçÔ∏è I recently decided I wanted to start writing publicly in order to force myself to refine my thinking a bit more.

üìö I've recently started tracking my books with the [margins](https://margins.app/) app (Goodreads, but good). There's no public profile over there yet, but I'm sure it's coming.

For now, I track my writing and books in [notion](https://seankonz.notion.site/Public-Blog-17cb3e4834b68079b2b5cdfc7dba6b99?pvs=4). If I ever get more serious about writing, I'll probably start posting on [substack](https://substack.com/@swkonz) instead.
