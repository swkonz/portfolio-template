# Bag of Words

‚úçÔ∏è I started writing in college, but more for private thoughts. I recently decided I wanted to start writing publicly in order to force myself to refine my thinking a bit more. I didn't build up a writing habit until my college years - I wish I'd started earlier. It's one of the best ways I've found to clear my mind and refine my thoughts.

üìö I started reading a lot more in the past few years. I didn't read much for leasure when I was young, but I finally built a habit of reading during the pandemic. I've recently started tracking my books with the [margins](https://margins.app/) app (Goodreads, but good). There's no public profile over there yet, but I'm sure it's coming.

For now, I track my writing and books in [notion](https://seankonz.notion.site/me). If I ever get more serious about writing, I'll probably start posting on [substack](https://substack.com/@swkonz) instead.
