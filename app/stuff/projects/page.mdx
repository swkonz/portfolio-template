# Projects

Assortment of projects from over the years. These are things that helped shape my interests and technical skillset, but I don't always get to share much detail about them. For a more complete professional history, check my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-k-19a327b2/).

## Independent Contracting

My contract work spans software MVP development and hiring software teams. Some past engagements:

- [Journey Bio](https://www.journeybio.life/): Patient & Provider portal for tests.
- Vergil: User and Admin portal and Government integration
- Udelv: Teleoperations and Fleet Operations System development

## Teaching

### Lecturer - San Francisco State University

I taught ENGR 456: Computer Systems at SF State in Spring 2023. I missed systems level programming and studying hardware and wanted to brush up on those skills. Plus, I missed teaching. I taught a lot at Stanford and missed the precision of understanding required in order to teach.

ENGR 456 was an introductory Computer Systems class spanning instruction sets, pipeline design, and assembly programming.

### Stanford CS 107E

Thanks to some incredible instructors, the course has developed a lot since my time. When I was at Stanford, we rebuilt the course infrastructure from scratch to get away from some **scary** bash scripts that were (kind of) holding things together. When I was around, we were still using Raspberry Pi A boards (uniprocessors!). Thankfully, they've moved up in the world to a Risc-V processor now ðŸ˜ƒ. [Course Github](https://github.com/cs107e).

107E gave me a tremendous amount of confidence in my embedded / systems programming skills. I highly reccomend learning systems programming to all engineers. It's hard to gain a greater appreciation for the elegance of processors and programming than you do when you do bare metal programming.

#### Raspberry Pi Arcade

During some covid duldrums and in preparation for the next batch of CS 107E, I put together a raspberry pi arcade demo. Wood enclosure, joysticks, crappy wiring jobs. Everything from the GPIO drivers, graphics drivers, and heap allocator were written from scratch. [github](https://github.com/swkonz/rpi-arcade)

### Stanford CS Section Leader

In addition to CS 107E, I was also a TA/Section leader for CS 107 and CS 106A/B for most of my undergrad. The section leading program was my first foray into teaching outside of tutoring work.

## Invicted --> Vergil

I co-founded Invicted with [Patrick Robinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-robinson-4282a21) and [Vineet Kosaraju](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vineet-kosaraju-0782348a) in 2017 to build products and services to help formerly incarcerated people and returning citizens. We worked on various products ideas including a software-based impairment detection (for replacing cumbersome and invasive drug screening tools), a resource hub (for collecting information on what tools and services helped people most when returning home), and a guide tool to formalize steps and processes that most returning citizens or probationees find helpful. I went on to continue working on Invicted with Ideas42 where we built Vergil and went on to close contracts with county probation departments and receive over $1M in grant funding.

## Stanford ME 210 - Mechatronics

Classic engineering school project. Fond memories. [Site](https://wintetheroomba.weebly.com/)
