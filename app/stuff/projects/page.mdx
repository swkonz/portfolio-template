# Projects

Assortment of projects from over the years. These are things that helped shape my interests and technical skillset, but I don't always get to share much detail about them. For a more complete professional history, check my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-k-19a327b2/).

## Independent Contracting

When time permits, I take on some contract software develoment work. Some past engagements:

- [Tiny Dinner](https://www.tiny-dinner.com/) Dinner Party club. Helped hire initial technical team and define product stack. NextJS, Postgres.
- [Journey Bio](https://www.journeybio.life/): Patient & Provider portal for kidney disease tests. Vue2, Node, Postgres
- Vergil: User and admin portal. Government Case management integration. Mobile-first web development with React, Node, and Postgres.
- Udelv: Teleoperations and Fleet Operations System development for Autonomous delivery vehicles. ROS, Nvidia GStreamer, React, Node, and postgres.

## Teaching

### Lecturer - San Francisco State University

I taught ENGR 456: Computer Systems at SF State in Spring 2023. I missed systems programming and studying hardware and wanted to brush up on those skills. Plus, I missed teaching. I taught a lot at Stanford and missed the precision of understanding required in order to teach.

ENGR 456 was an introductory Computer Systems class spanning instruction sets, pipeline design, and assembly programming.

### Stanford CS 107E

Thanks to some incredible instructors, the course has developed a lot since my time. When I was at Stanford, we rebuilt the course infrastructure from scratch to get away from some **scary** bash scripts that were (kind of) holding things together. When I was around, we were still using Raspberry Pi A boards (uniprocessors!). Thankfully, they've moved up in the world to a Risc-V processor now ðŸ˜ƒ. [Course Github](https://github.com/cs107e).

107E was formative for me as a student and as an instructor. I highly reccomend learning systems programming to all engineers. It's hard to gain a greater appreciation for the elegance of processors and programming than you do with bare metal programming.

#### Raspberry Pi Arcade

During some covid duldrums and in preparation for the next batch of CS 107E, I put together a raspberry pi arcade demo. Wood enclosure, joysticks, crappy wiring jobs. Everything was written from scratch and ran bare metal (no operating system). That included the GPIO drivers, graphics drivers, and heap allocator. [github](https://github.com/swkonz/rpi-arcade)

### Stanford CS Section Leader

I was also a TA/Section leader for CS 107 and CS 106A/B for most of my undergrad (2017 - 2020). The section leading program was my first foray into teaching outside of tutoring work. Another formative experience.

## Invicted --> Vergil

I co-founded Invicted with [Patrick Robinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-robinson-4282a21) and [Vineet Kosaraju](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vineet-kosaraju-0782348a) in 2017 to build products and services to help formerly incarcerated people and returning citizens. We worked on various products ideas including a software-based impairment detection (for replacing cumbersome and invasive drug screening tools), a resource hub (for collecting information on what tools and services helped people most when returning home), and a guide tool to formalize steps and processes that most returning citizens or probationees find helpful. I went on to continue working on Invicted with Ideas42 where we built Vergil and went on to close contracts with county probation departments and receive over $1M in grant funding.

## Stanford ME 210 - Mechatronics

Classic engineering school project. Fond memories. [Site](https://wintetheroomba.weebly.com/)
